//  VIGIL — License Gate (neutralized)
// ==========================================================================
//  This product ships as a single edition — there is no community / pro /
//  enterprise tier split. LicenseGate used to render an UpgradeBanner when
//  the active license didn't include a feature; it now renders its children
//  unconditionally. Kept as a thin pass-through so existing call sites
//  (and tests that mock it) keep working without edits.
// ==========================================================================
