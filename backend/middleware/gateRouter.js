/**
 * middleware/gateRouter.js
 * ─────────────────────────
 * Wrap an entire router (or a sub-set of routes) behind a feature flag.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const trace = createTraceRouter({ getQueryFn });
 *   app.use('/', gateRouter(pool, 'trace_correlation', trace));
 *
 *   const scim = createScimRouter({ scimService, authenticate: scimAuth });
 *   app.use('/scim/v2', gateRouter(pool, 'scim_provisioning', scim));
 *
 * The gate relies on requireFeature(pool, feature) and therefore honours the
 * existing tier → feature mapping in enterprise/licensing/tiers.js.
 *
 * Super admins bypass the gate (as in requireFeature).
 * Requests that fail the gate receive the same 403 shape produced by
 * requireFeature, so UI error handling is uniform.
