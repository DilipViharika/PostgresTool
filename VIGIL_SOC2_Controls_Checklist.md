# VIGIL — SOC 2 Type II Controls Checklist

**Purpose.** This document is an internal, engineering-facing checklist of the controls VIGIL must have in place _before the SOC 2 Type II observation window opens_. It maps each control to (a) the Trust Service Criterion it satisfies, (b) the owning team, (c) the artifact a SOC 2 auditor will ask for, and (d) the current status. It is _not_ the audit itself — it is the preparation sheet an auditor would expect to see on the first day of kickoff.

**Scope.** The initial SOC 2 engagement covers Security (mandatory) plus Availability and Confidentiality. Privacy and Processing Integrity are out of scope for the first year and will be reassessed before the Year 2 renewal.

**Observation window target.** Minimum 3 months for a Type II report (6 months preferred).

**Status legend.** `[x]` in place · `[~]` partial · `[ ]` not yet started.

## How to read this document

Each Trust Service Criterion section contains a table of specific controls. A control "in place" means every one of the following is true: there is a written policy, the control is enforced in the product or in an operational process, and there is an artifact an auditor can inspect (a log export, a Jira ticket, a signed attestation, a Git history, a configuration screenshot, etc.). Anything short of all three is `[~]` or `[ ]`.

## Pre-audit readiness punch list

The items below are the ones most likely to delay a SOC 2 Type II report if not closed before the observation window opens. They are ordered by leverage — completing them early pays off across the whole audit.

1. **Change-management policy.** Write it down. Branch protection already enforces most of it; the policy document just needs to be authored, signed, and filed.
2. **Vendor risk register.** Enumerate every sub-processor, obtain each one's SOC 2 report (or equivalent), store the DPA. Auditors will ask for this on day 1.
3. **Access-review cadence.** Schedule quarterly access reviews now so that at least one cycle falls within the observation window. Each review produces a signed Jira ticket.
4. **Incident-response runbook.** Expand the partial runbook into a complete document covering detection, triage, communication, remediation, and postmortem, with sample incidents walked through end-to-end.
5. **Encryption-at-rest verification.** Capture the cloud-console screenshots that show AES-256 enabled on every production data store. Auditors will not accept "it's on by default" — they want the evidence.
6. **Tamper-evident audit log.** Ship the cryptographic-chain verification and retention enforcement. This is the single most visible product-side C1 control and directly backs multiple CC6 controls as well.
7. **Backup and restore drill.** Run at least one full restore test during the observation window and document the outcome.
8. **Background check policy.** Required for CC1.3; easiest to set up is a vendor contract with Checkr or similar and backfill for existing staff.
9. **Board-approved information security policy.** Draft, present at the next board meeting, capture minutes.
10. **Cyber-liability insurance.** Bind the policy before the observation window closes; auditors look for effective-dated coverage across the entire window.

---

## Observation-window entry criteria

The observation window should not begin until:

- every control marked `[x]` above has produced at least one month of passing evidence,
- every `[~]` has been promoted to `[x]` or has a dated plan with owner assignment,
- every `[ ]` has a dated plan with owner assignment even if implementation is not yet complete — the auditor will want to see the work in progress rather than a cold silence.

---

_This checklist is a living document. Update it whenever a control's status changes, and review it at the beginning of every quarter._
